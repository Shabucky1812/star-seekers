# Star Seekers
[View the Live Website here](https://star-seekers.herokuapp.com/)

Star Seekers is a fake social group that hosts late-night events for lovers of the night sky. The aim of this Star Seekers website is to allow the group to reach out to it's current members and entice new ones to join. 
Using the website, users can view details about the group, view upcoming events, ask questions about events, and book a place for them and a group of up to 4 at events.
Admins can also use the website to create new events, edit existing events, and delete events when necessary. Additionally, using the admin panel, admins can create, edit, and delete event guides, and create, edit, and delete question answers.
